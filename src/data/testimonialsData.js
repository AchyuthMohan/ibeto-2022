The event was organized in a manner that provided us with creative freedom, motivation, inspiration, guidance and a healthy competitive spirit. I thank the organizers and mentors who were strong and reliable pillars of support and helping up push through challenges. It was a wonderful learning experience.',

I could pick up quite a few things on my journey being a part of this event. Though fate may not have been by my side on the winning streak, I have garnered much more. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the organising committee for being spot on. Their hard work is reflected as it is very hard to see such good events being put up. Events like these could be a game-changer to the participants.",
